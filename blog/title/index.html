<p>Successful client relationships can include numerous factors, but one of the oft-overlooked methods of showing your preferred clients that you care is to send them a gift – a present you know will mean something to them. A thank-you card or phone call is nice, but don’t stop there. There are specific reasons you need to send gifts to your clients on occasion, too.</p>
<p>Corporate Giving Is Important</p>
<p>Corporate gift giving is on the rise, as more and more discover the benefits of sending a special something to those they work with on occasion. From subscription gifting to gift hampers to wine and flowers, how you give to clients says a lot about you as a professional. Choosing the right gift and method of giving is important. But even more important is making the choice to proactively seek out your client’s preferences and make a friendly gesture in the form of something nice for them to have that reminds them you value the business relationship they share with you.</p>
<p>Why Send Gifts to Your Clients</p>
<p>In marketing, there is something known as a “drip campaign,” in which companies make sure they keep touching their customers via email or mail to nurture the relationship and encourage future business. Certain benefits come from this constant contact. The same principle holds true in corporate giving. Here are four, specific reasons you need to send gifts to your clients on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Gifts Bridge Divides - Regardless of where you are geographically speaking, you can send gifts to clients that make them feel close even when you may be on separate continents.
Personalized Gifting Reinforces Your Brand - If you value your brand, show those who chose to do business with you that your brand stands for relationships, thoughtfulness, and going the extra mile. Many corporate gifting services allow for customisable branding, which means your business logo accompanies the warmth felt by the recipient.
Staying in Touch Keeps the Relationship Open - Remember the drip campaign? When your gift arrives, it opens up the lines of contact. The client will most likely reply, providing you the opportunity to discuss ongoing business needs and solutions. Perhaps you sent your client a gift hamper on her birthday, but that hamper will likely sit on her desk for days, keeping you and your business in the front of her mind.
Gifting Sets You Apart From the Competition - Chances are, you aren’t the only business your client works with, but gifting may help you be their favourite. People do business with those they know and like. Sending a thoughtful gift is the perfect way to distinguish your business as a preferred partner.</p>
